**Attention:** 1.6.0 is not a recommended version to use because of known issues where pods can get stuck (due to controller publish/unpublish failures) during cluster upgrades or during node reboot (as seen in [#987](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gcp-compute-persistent-disk-csi-driver/pull/987)). Users should upgrade directly to the 1.7 branch.
